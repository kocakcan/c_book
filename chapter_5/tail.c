/* Write the program tail, which prints the last n lines of its input. By
 * default, n is set to 10, let us say, but it can be changed by an optional
 * argument so that
 *
 *   tail -n
 * prints the last n lines. The program should behave rationally no matter
 * unreasonable the input or the value of n. Write the program so it makes the
 * best use of available storage; lines should be stored as in the sorting
 * program, not in a two-dimensional array of fixed size.
