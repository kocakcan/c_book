/***
 * 5.4 Address Arithmetic
 *
 * If p is a pointer to some element of an array, then p++ increments p to
 * point to the next element, and p += i increments it to point i elements
 * beyond where it currently does. These an similar constructions are the
 * simplest forms of pointer or address arithmetic.
