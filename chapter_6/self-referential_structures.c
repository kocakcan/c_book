/***
 * 6.5 Self-Referential Structures
 *
 * Suppose we want to handle the more general problem of counting the
 * occurrences of all the words in some input. Since the list of words isn't
 * known in advance, we can't conveniently sort it and use a binary search. Yet
 * we can't do a linear search for each word as it arrives, to see if it's
 * already been seen; the program would take too long. (More precisely, its
 * running time is likely to grow quadratically with the number of input words.)
 * How can we organize the data to copy efficiently with a list of arbitrary
 * words?
 *
 * One solution is to keep the set of words seen so far sorted at all times, by
 * placing each word into its proper position in the order as it arrives. This
 * shouldn't be done by shifting words in a linear array, though - that also
 * takes too long. Instead we use a data structure called a binary tree.
 *
 * The tree contains one "node" per distinct word; each node contains
 *
 * -> A pointer to the text of the word
 * -> A count of the number of occurrences
 * -> A pointer to the left child node
 * -> A pointer to the right child node
 *
 * No node may have more than two children; it might have only zero or one.
 *
 * The nodes are maintained so that at any node the left subtree contains only
 * words that are lexicographically less than the word at the node, and the
 * right subtree contains only words that are greater.
 *
 * To find out whether a new word is already in the tree, start at the root and
 * compare the new word to the word stored at that node. If they match, the
 * question is answered affirmatively. If the new record is less than the tree
 * word, continue searching at the left child, otherwise at the right child. If
 * there is no child in the required direction, the word is not in the tree, and
 * in fact the empty slot is the proper place to add the new word. This process
 * is recursive, since the search from any node uses a search from one of its
 * children. Accordingly, recursive routines for insertion and printing will be
 * most natural.
 *
 * Going back to the description of a node, it is mostly conveniently
 * represented as a structure with four components:
 *
 *  struct tnode {        -> the tree node
 *    char *word;         -> points to the text
 *    int count;          -> number of occurrences
 *    struct tnode *left; -> left child
 *    struct tnode *right -> right child
 *  };
 * This recursive declaration of a node might look chancy, but it's correct. It
 * is illegal for a structure to contain an instance of itself, but
 *
 *  struct tnode *left;
 * declares left to be a pointer to a tnode, not a tnode itself.
 *
 * Occassionally, one needs a variation of self-referential structures: two
 * structures that refer to each other. The way to handle this is:
 *
 *  struct t {
 *    ...
 *    struct s *p;  -> p points to an s
 *  };
 *
 *  struct s {
 *    ...
 *    struct t *q;  -> q points to a q
 *  };
 * The code for the whole program is surprisingly small, given a handful of
 * supporting routines like getword that we have already written. The main
 * routine reads words with getword and installs them in the tree with addtree.

/***
 * The function addtree is recursive. A word is presented by main to the top
 * level (the root) of the tree. At each stage, that word is compared to the
 * word already stored at the node, and is percolated down to either left or
 * right subtree by a recursive call to addtree. Eventually, the word either
 * matches something already in the tree (in which case the count is
 * incremented), or a null pointer is encountered, indicating that a node must
 * be created and added to the tree. If a new node is created, addtree returns a
 * pointer to it, which is installed in the parent node.
 *
 * Storage for the new node is fetched by a routine talloc, which returns a
 * pointer to a free space suitable for holding a tree node, and the new word
 * is copied into a hidden space by strdup. The count is initialized, and the
 * two children are made null. This part of the code is executed only at the
 * leaves of the tree, when a new node is being added.
 *
 * treeprint prints the tree in sorted order; at each node, it prints the left
 * subtree (all the words less than this word), then the word itself, then the
 * right subtree (all the words greater).

/***
 * A practical note: if the tree becomes "unbalanced" because the words don't
 * arrive in random order, the running time of the program can grow too much.
 * As a worst case, if the words are already in order, this program does an
 * expensive simulation of linear search. There are generalizations of the
 * binary tree that do not suffer from this worst-case behaviour.
 *
 * Clearly it's desirable that there be only one storage allocator in a program,
 * even though it allocates different kinds of objects. But if one allocator is
 * to process requests for, say, pointers to chars and pointers to struct
 * tnodes, two questions arise. First, how does it meet the requirement of most
 * real machines that objects of certain types must satisfy alignment
 * restrictions (for example, integers often must be located at even addresses)?
 * Second, what declarations can cope with the fact that an allocator must
 * necessarily return different kinds of pointers?
 *
 * Alignment requirements can generally be satisfied easily, at the cost of some
 * wasted space, by ensuring that the allocator always returns a pointer that
 * meets all alignment restrictions.
 *
 * The question of the type declaration for a function like malloc is a vexing
 * one for any language that takes its type-checking seriously. In C, the proper
 * method is to declare that malloc returns a pointer to void, then explicitly
 * coerce the pointer into the desired type with a cast.
