/***
 * 4.9 Initialization
 *
 * In the absence of explicit initialization, external and static variables are
 * guaranteed to be initialized to zero; automatic and register variables have
 * undefined (i.e., garbage) initial values.
 *
 * Scalar variables may be initialized when they are defined, by following the
 * name with an equals sign and an expression.
 *
 * 	int x = 1;
 * 	char squota = '\'';
 * 	long day = 1000L * 60L * 60L * 24L; -> milliseconds/day
 *
 * For external and static variables, the initializer must be a constant
 * expression; the initialization is done once, conceptionally before the
 * program begins execution. For automatic and register variables, the
 * initializer is not restricted to being a constant; it may be any expression
 * involving previously defined values, even function calls. For example, the
 * initialization of the binary search program could be written as
 *
 * 	int binsearch(int x, int v[], int n)
 * 	{
 * 		int low = 0;
 * 		int high = n - 1;
 * 		int mid;
 * 	}
 *
 * instead of
 *
 * 	int low, high, mid;
 *
 * 	low = 0;
 * 	high = n - 1;
 *
 * In effect, initialization of automatic variables are just shorthand for
 * assignment statements. Which form to prefer is largely a matter of taste.
 *
 * An array may be initialized by following its declaration with a list of
 * initializers enclosed in braces and seperated by commas. For example, to
 * initialize an array days with the number of days in each month:
 *
 * 	int days[] = { 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31 }
 *
 * When the size of the array is omitted, the compiler will compute the length
 * by counting the initializers, of which there are 12 in this case.
 *
 * If there are fewer initializers for an array than the specified size, the
 * others will be zero for external, static and automatic variables. It is an
 * error to have too many initializers. There is no way to specify repetition
 * of an initializer, nor to initialize an element in the middle of the array
 * without supplying all the preeceding values as well.
 *
 * Character arrays are a special case of initialization; a string may be used
 * instead of braces and commas notation:
 *
 * 	char *pattern = "ould";
 * is a shorthand for the longer but equivalent
 * 	char pattern[] = { 'o', 'u', 'l', 'd', '\0' };
 *
 * In this case, the array size is five (four character plus the terminating
 * '\0').
